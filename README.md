# Othello-game
Single/Multiplayer Othello game which receives coordinates from the player and displays the board on screen. Strategies are designed for single-player bot to make moves based on the state of the board.
## Warning
The report first page is in Japanese, but almost all the contents are in English due to my improficiency in Japanese writing skills at that time.
