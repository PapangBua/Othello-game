# Othello-game
Single/Multiplayer Othello game which receives coordinates from the player and displays the board on screen. Strategies are designed for single-player bot to make moves based on the state of the board.
## Warning
1. The report first page is in Japanese, but almost all the contents are in English due to my improficiency in Japanese writing skills at that time.
2. Currently in search for the code as I changed my computer.
